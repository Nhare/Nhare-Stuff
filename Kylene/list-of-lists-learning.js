for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
  // access each item in list
  var item = list[i]
  
  // e.g. if item is a number
  print "i have " + i + " nicks in prison".
  
  // but what if item is not a number? what if item is also a list? so list is a list of lists
  // you can still treat the variable "item" exactly as you would a normal list
  for (var j = 0; j < item.length; j++) {
    var sub_item = item[j]
  }
}


// more concrete example
var board = [
[ 1, 2, 3],
[ 4, 5, 6],
[ 7, 8, 9],
];

// so board is a list of lists
for (var i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
  // access each list in the list of lists
  var b = board[i]
  
  // what is b when i = 0? i = 1? i=2 ?  hint: see the "item" exampel above. remember that "board" is list of lists.
  var b = board[i] thought? board[1] is the 2nd list for example is it not? where as board [1][1] would be 5  

  [1, 2, 3] is correct. its a list. and the list contains [1,2,3]
  
  // so what is b when i=1 and i=2? 

  // now access each item in b
  for (var j = 0; j < b.length; j++) {
    var x= b[j];
    
    // what is x when i=0 and j=0?  what is x when i=2 and j=1? 
    x = 1 x = 8 , i think this might be brilliant x/j are the board[2][1] positions im going to have to work with continually on this project i think
  }

var truth = [
[kylene, is, really, fucking, awesome],
[he, happens, to, be, amazing],

for(var i = 0; i < truth.length; i++){
    var b = truth[i];
    
    for (var j = 0; j < b.length; j++){
        var x = b[j];
        
    }
}    

What is x when i = 0 and j = 0? What is x when i = 0 and j 1? What is x when i = 1 and j = 4? What is x when i = 2 and j = 0? What is x when i = 2 and j = 1?
